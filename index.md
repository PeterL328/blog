# About me

Iâ€™m a software engineer studying computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am skilled in data analysis frameworks such as Pandas, NumPy, Scipy and Pytorch and in back-end/database tools such as Flask/Tornado, NodeJS  and PostgreSQL/MySQL. I have experience with AWS EC2, ECS, Lambda, Gateway and RDS. In my spare time, I like to participate in hackathons.
