# About me

I'm a blockchain engineer currently studying computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in building decentralized applications using Solidity, WebJS and Truffle. I am also skilled in back-end/database tools such as Flask/Tornado, NodeJS and PostgreSQL and front-end frameworks such as AngularJS. I have experience with AWS EC2, ECS, Lambda, Gateway and RDS. In my internships, I have worked a lot with Python to process and visualize data, using tools such as GDAL for geospatial images, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. In my spare time, I like to participate in hackathons.
